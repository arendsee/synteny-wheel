This is an implementation of a data structure for navigating links between
two circular genomes. It is a small piece of an extension to my code-base
I am planning to do in the near(ish) future.

I have implemented all the IO and general structure. What remains to be
done is filling out the functions in algorithms.c.

If anything is unclear, or if you have any questions, feel free to write
me.
